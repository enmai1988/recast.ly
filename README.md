### About React

React is **declarative**, rather than **imperative**. In the other words, instead of writing code to tell the computer how to do things, you tell the computer what you need.

So if we would like to render a house in JavaScript in a imperative way, the code may look something like:

```
> draw a rectangle
> fill it with some colors
> draw a triagnle
...
```

vs. in React, the code may look like:

```
> I want a 🏡 with black color
```

React is an interesting library. Yes, It's a library, not a framework. It's interesting in a few ways:

- Unlike Angular, React is a library that handles the view in MVC and uses one way data flow.
- React uses a virtual DOM to compare changes and only re-render the sub components that's changed.
- React recommends JSX which allows you to put your logics and markups together.
